**Privacy Policy: Yupoo Stealth Downloader**

**Last Updated: 03-01-2026**

1. **Overview** This Privacy Policy describes how the "Yupoo Stealth Downloader" Chrome Extension handles user data. Our primary goal is to provide a tool for image organization and downloading while maintaining the highest standards of user privacy.

2. **Data Collection and Usage**

- **No Personal Data Collection:** The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or browsing history.

- **On-Device Processing:** All data processing, including the identification of image URLs on Yupoo catalogs, occurs locally on the user's device.

- **Website Content Access:** The extension accesses website content (URLs of images) exclusively to provide the core functionality of listing and downloading images from the current active tab.

3. **Data Sharing** We do not sell, trade, or share any information with third parties. Since no data is collected or transmitted to external servers, there is no database of user information to share.

4. **Permissions** The permissions requested (activeTab, scripting, downloads, declarativeNetRequest) are used solely to:

- Identify images on the page for the user to select.

- Modify headers (Referer) to bypass server-side blocks during the download process.

- Save the selected files to the user's local "Downloads" folder.

5. **Changes to This Policy** We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
